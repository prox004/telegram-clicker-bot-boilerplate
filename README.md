# Coin Clicker App

The Coin Clicker App is an engaging and interactive application where users can increase their coin balance by clicking on a coin. The progress increases with each click until it eventually resets to zero after a cooldown period.

## Features

- **Incremental Clicking**: Click the coin to increase the balance.
- **Auto Reset**: Progress bar fills up and resets after reaching 100%.
- **Cooldown Period**: Coin clicking is disabled during the cooldown, and the progress bar gradually decreases.
- **Interactive UI**: Clean and user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure

The project consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the app.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for app functionality.
